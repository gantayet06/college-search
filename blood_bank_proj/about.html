          <h4 id="about_h">Our Goal</h4>
          <p id="about_p">This application reduces the time to a greater extent that is
            searching for the required blood through blood banks and hospitals.
            Thus this application provides the required information in less time
            and also helps in quicker decision making. Blood banking is the
            process that takes place in the lab to make sure that donated blood,
            or blood products, are safe before they are used in blood transfusions
            and other medical procedures. Blood banking includes typing the blood
            for transfusion and testing for infectious diseases.
